# NYC CitiBike Data Analysis

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze the bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York. We will be sharing our findings with investors who are looking to begin a CitiBike program in Des Moines. Below are the main keys discussed in this presentation:

- Demographics of the NY CitiBike  program users.
- Trip duration per user, as well as per gender.
- Weekday trips per day, hour and gender.

### Purpose

We used the analytical tool Tableau to create worksheets, dashboards and a story to visualize our data analysis outcomes and provide some recommendations to our potential investors. You can find the Story presented via tableau using this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zeinab.bahsoun/viz/Bikesharing_16700573951020/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes). 

### Analyzing the Data

The data presented below shows the total count of rides per user type and customer gender breakdown. More than 3/4 of the users are subscribers which indicates that there’s a big number of users who trust the service provided and use it frequently. The male gender count is dominant, 2 times over the female user count, and the unknown or undefined gender count is around half of the female gender user count. 
Since August is a beautiful time of the year to rent a bike, we want to use this data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.
The bar chart below shows the peak hours for the month of August that are from 5 PM till 7 PM, this is the timeframe where users leave their work and use the bike as a transportation, it also is the time where the sun starts setting and the summer heat is more bearable to be outside. 
This line graph shows the count peak of users is between 140K and 150K for around 4 to 6 minutes trip duration and then the count drops gradually to reach around 1K users riding the bike for around an hour. As mentioned earlier, the number of male users is much higher than female and unknown gender users.  
 
The highest number of users reaches over 1million during the weekdays between 8 AM to 9 AM, and 5PM to 7 PM, while the heavy bike usage during the weekend is between 11AM and 1PM, dominated by male gender users. 
The below heatmap presents the most active day of the week for both males and females subscribers is on Thursday.

### Results
Bikeshare services are mostly used around morning and evening commute times, the number of male users is much higher than others, and a very large number of users ride the bike between 4-6 minutes.

### Recommendations
To have more insight on how to improve the CitiBike service, and a better understanding of the user’s needs:

- Track the starting and ending point/location of each bike ride, this way we can have a better understanding on how to improve our stations and services in relation to the area.
